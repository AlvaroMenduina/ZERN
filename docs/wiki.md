## [1] Zernike polynomials
The Zernike polynomials are a set of orthogonal polynomials in the unit circle. The low-order Zernike polynomials correspond to common optical aberrations such as astigmatism or coma and thus, constitute a useful basis for describing wavefront maps.

Zernike polynomials have both two $n, m$, the first one representing the *radial* order, the second one representing the *azimuth* order.
